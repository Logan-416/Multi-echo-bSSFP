# Multi-echo balanced SSFP with a sequential phase-encoding order for functional MR imaging at 7T
We developed a 2D multi-echo passband balanced SSFP (bSSFP) sequence using an echo-train readout with a sequential phase-encoding order (sequential multi-echo bSSFP) at 7T. As images of sequential multi-echo bSSFP exhibit multiple ghosts due to rapid and periodic k-space modulations, a GRAPPA-based reconstruction method was proposed to eliminate ghosting artifacts.

This repository contains sample data (https://zenodo.org/record/6622541#.YqB8IqhByUm) and reconstruction codes for sequential multi-echo bSSFP (ETL = 3, in-plane resolution = 1x1 mm2).
